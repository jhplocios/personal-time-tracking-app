## Personal Time Tracking Web App

### An Overview

Personal Time Tracking App is a simple tool to help you keep track, monitor and measure your daily activities.
Its easy to forget what you did these past days due to deadlines and fast-paced environment. That is why keeping a record 
is necessary but bringing a notebook and pen sometimes can be bit hassle also. Why not keep a record on an easy to use app?
This is what this app is trying to do for you, With a simple and easy to use interface, you can now manage your time easily.

This app uses React and Typescript in the frontend and Node and Javascript in the backend.
I used create-react-app as a boilerplate for the frontend code.
The data is persisted to MongoDb Atlas.
